This repo is a fork of the [original g3data repo](http://github.com/pn2200/g3data/). The original repo was not maintained anymore, and this one should be the one with the new features.


What is g3data?
---------------
g3data is a tool for extracting data from scanned graphs. For graphs
published in scientific articles the actual data is usually not
explicitly given; g3data makes the process of extracting this data easy.
